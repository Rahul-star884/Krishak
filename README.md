Share your hackathon journey — challenges, learnings, fun moments, or shout-outs!
deation Phase:
We started by identifying real problems faced by rural farmers and artisans — lack of digital reach, tool access, real-time mandi prices, and expert advice.

Our goal: Bridge the gap between rural talent and digital platforms.

 Planning & Research:
Spent time researching farmer issues, government schemes, and existing platforms.

We sketched wireframes, divided tasks, and chose React, Firebase, and Cloudinary for development.

 Development Phase:
Faced issues with routing, backend integration, and image uploads — but solved them one by one.

Built modular components: product upload, services page, expert advice, weather info, and more.

 Challenges Faced:
Initial GitHub errors and package bugs.

Time management was tough, but we kept pushing with teamwork and learning.

 Outcome:
A working web platform that allows product selling, checks mandi prices, weather info, tool renting, expert AI chat, and more.

Simple, scalable, and built for real-world impact.
